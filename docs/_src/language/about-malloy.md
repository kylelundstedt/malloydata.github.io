# The Story of Malloy

Malloy was designed by a team of people with a lot of experience in
understanding the task of extracting meaning from data. Years of constant
exposure to SQL resulted in a tremendous sense of wonder at the
power of SQL ... and a tremendous source of frustration at how
bad SQL is at representing the types of operations needed to
get meaningful data out of relational databases, and how
difficult it is to maintain and extend a complex set
of transformations written in SQL.

Malloy started as a "clean slate" thought experiment, if we knew
all the things we know about data, and about programming with data,
and about programming languages in general, and we were designing
a query language today, what would it look like.

In it's earliest form, Malloy looked a lot like SQL, and
much of Malloy continues to be influenced by the overall
design of the SQL language. It was always the intention that there
could be a document that would contain both Malloy and SQL
and those would make sense together, perhaps parallel to
the way Javascript and Typescript work together.
