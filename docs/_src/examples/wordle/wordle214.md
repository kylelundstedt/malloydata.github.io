Query for best Starting words.

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true,  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size":"small","source": "wordle/wordlebot.malloy", "showAs":"html"}
query: wordle->find_words
```

Start with a word without duplicates to get coverage.  Today we choose 'SLATE'

Query for words that Contain 'T', don't have 'T' in the 4th spot and don't have the Letters 'SLAE'. Rank them by the number
of possible space matches.

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true,  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size":"small","source": "wordle/wordlebot.malloy", "showAs":"html"}
query: wordle->find_words{
  where:
    word ~ r'T'
    and word ~ r'...[^T].'
    and word !~ r'[SLAE]'
}
```

'TIGHT" has two Ts so skip it. Next best word..  'TOUCH'

Query for words that Contain 'T', don't have 'T' in the 1st and 4th spot.  Has O in the second spot.  and don't have the Letters 'SLAEUCH'.

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true,  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size":"small","source": "wordle/wordlebot.malloy", "showAs":"html"}
query: wordle->find_words{
  where:
    word ~ r'T'
    and word ~ r'[^T]O.[^T].'
    and word !~ r'[SLAEUCH]'
}
```

## Solved in 4!


### Code For Wordlbot:

```malloy

-- Make a table of 5 letter words
explore: words is table('malloy-data.malloytest.words'){
  query: five_letter_words is {
    where: length(word) = 5 and  word ~ r'^[a-z]....$'
    project: word is UPPER(word)
  }
}

-- Cross join numbers
explore: numbers is table('malloy-data.malloytest.numbers'){
  where: num <= 5

  -- code to fake a cross join
  primary_key: a -- key to fake a cross join
  dimension: a is 'a';
}

-- Build a new table of word and each letter in position
explore: words_and_letters is from(words->five_letter_words){
  -- Cross join is missing at the moment
  join: numbers on a
  dimension: a is 'a' -- key to fake a cross join

  query: words_and_position is {
    group_by: word
    nest: letters is {
      order_by: 2
      group_by: [
        letter is substr(word, numbers.num, 1)
        position is numbers.num

      ]
    }
  }
}

-- build a word finder that can generate a score best available guess.
explore: wordle is from(words_and_letters->words_and_position){
  where: word !~ r'(S|ED)$'
  measure: word_count is count()

  query: find_words is {
    group_by: [
      letters.letter
      letters.position
    ]
    aggregate: word_count
    nest: words_list is {
      group_by: word
    }
  }->{
    group_by: words_list.word
    aggregate: score is word_count.sum()
  }
}
```
